# Circuit simulators

Frequency circuit simulators solve the Sparameters of a circuit that connects several components, each of which is described by its Sparameters.

You can use 3 circuit simulators:

1. SAX (open source). Based on Google's Machine learning library JAX.
2. Ansys Lumerical interconnect.

## SPICE & Electrical Codesign Tools

It is often desired to be able to extract the electrical interconnect netlist from a layout component. This extracted netlist could then be transformed to perform SPICE simulations, or even more advanced electronic co-design.
